# electronic-music-production

This project is about listing all resources that I use or used to produce electronic music.  
It's a mix between learning and tools.  
Hope you will enjoy this and if you have any new resources worth sharing, this is an open-source project, simply create a PR to contribute or an issue to open the discussion!

## Learning

For the 2 first resources, Ableton did an amazing job covering two amazing core subjects about electronic music production with a lot of interactivity. Just click on one of them and enjoy the experience!

In my opinion, YouTube is one of the best places on the internet to learn anything, including electronic music production. I used to begin by reproducing projects, it's great because you get the reward, even if you didn't make it on your own, to produce something that is sounding good. Then, I went on more theoretical topics to unleash my creativity and productivity.

## Tools

To begin this chapter, we need to start with one of my favourites. It's the Vital Synth plugin.
Everyone knows Serum, but there is a free and open-source alternative, that is in my opinion, just better. Browse their website to find nice presets made by the community and tweak them to fit your project.

Another free VST, the BBC Symphony Orchestra Discover. If you need orchestra sounds, this plugin sounds amazing!

Great book explaining lots of drum machine patterns. You are going to find there drum midi programming patterns for Rock, Electro, House, DnB, Breaks, Drum Rolls, etc.. No bullshit in there, it goes straight to the point to produce music. The pdf is free if you can't afford the book!
